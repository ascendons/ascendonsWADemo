## Introduction

Welcome to the Divisha Appointment System! This guide will help you understand how to use the system, whether you're a patient booking appointments or an administrator managing the healthcare facility.

The system has two main parts:
- **WhatsApp Booking**: Patients can book appointments directly through WhatsApp
- **Admin Portal**: Administrators can manage doctors, schedules, patients, and appointments through a web dashboard

---

## For Patients: Booking Appointments via WhatsApp

### Getting Started

Booking an appointment through WhatsApp is simple and takes just a few minutes. You don't need to download any app or create an account - just use WhatsApp on your phone!

### Step-by-Step Booking Process

#### Step 1: Start the Conversation

1. Open WhatsApp on your phone
2. Send a message to the Divisha WhatsApp number (provided by your healthcare facility)
3. Type **"Hi"** or **"Hello"** to start

You'll receive an automated welcome message from the system.

#### Step 2: Register as a Patient (First Time Only)

If this is your first time booking:

1. The system will ask for your name
2. Provide your full name (e.g., "John Smith")
3. The system will then ask for your age
4. Enter your age (e.g., "35")
5. You may be asked for your gender (Male/Female/Other)
6. Once registered, you'll receive a Patient ID - save this for future reference!

**Note**: You only need to register once. For future appointments, the system will remember you.

#### Step 3: Book Your Appointment

After registration (or if you're already registered), the system will send you an interactive booking form. Here's what happens:

1. **Select a Doctor**
   - You'll see a list of available doctors
   - Tap on the doctor you want to see
   - The list shows only doctors who are currently available

2. **Choose a Location**
   - After selecting a doctor, you'll see locations where that doctor practices
   - Select the location that's most convenient for you
   - Some doctors work at multiple locations

3. **Pick a Date**
   - You'll see a calendar with available dates
   - Dates that are fully booked or unavailable will be grayed out
   - Select a date that works for you

4. **Select a Time Slot**
   - After choosing a date, you'll see available time slots
   - Time slots are shown in a 12-hour format (e.g., "9:00 AM", "2:30 PM")
   - Only available slots are shown - if a slot is already booked, it won't appear

5. **Review and Confirm**
   - Review all your selections:
     - Doctor name
     - Location
     - Date
     - Time
   - If everything looks correct, tap **"Confirm Booking"**
   - If you need to change something, you can go back and make changes

#### Step 4: Receive Confirmation

After confirming, you'll receive a booking confirmation message that includes:

- **Booking ID**: A unique number for your appointment (e.g., "BID-1234567890")
- **Doctor Name**: The doctor you'll be seeing
- **Location**: Where your appointment will take place
- **Date**: The date of your appointment
- **Time**: Your appointment time
- **Status**: Whether your appointment is "Confirmed" or "Waitlisted"

**Important**: Save your Booking ID! You'll need it if you want to reschedule or cancel your appointment.

### Appointment Statuses Explained

- **Confirmed**: Your appointment is booked and confirmed. You're all set! Arrive on time for your appointment.
- **Waitlisted**: The time slot you selected was already booked, but you've been added to a waitlist. This means:
  - You're on a waiting list for that time slot
  - If someone cancels, you may be automatically moved to "Confirmed" status
  - You can still reschedule to a different time if you prefer
  - Check your messages regularly for status updates
- **Walk-in**: You arrived at the clinic without a prior appointment. You'll be seen when the doctor is available.
- **Cancelled**: Your appointment has been cancelled. You'll need to book a new appointment if you want to see the doctor.
- **Completed**: Your appointment has been finished. This is shown in your appointment history.

### Rescheduling an Appointment

## Frequently Asked Questions

### For Patients

**Q: Do I need to download an app?**  
A: No! Everything works through WhatsApp, which you already have on your phone.

**Q: How do I know if my appointment is confirmed?**  
A: You'll receive a confirmation message with your Booking ID. The message will say "Confirmed" or "Waitlisted."

**Q: Can I book appointments for someone else?**  
A: Yes, but you'll need to register them as a patient first using their phone number.

**Q: What if I forget my Booking ID?**  
A: Contact your healthcare facility, and they can look up your appointment using your phone number or name.

A: This depends on your healthcare facility's settings. Typically, you can book up to several weeks in advance.

**Q: Can I cancel an appointment the same day?**  
A: Yes, you can cancel at any time, but please do so as early as possible so others can use that time slot.

### For Administrators

**Q: How do I add multiple doctors at once?**  
A: Currently, you need to add doctors one at a time through the Settings page. Contact your system administrator if you need to add many doctors at once.

**Q: Can a doctor work at multiple locations?**  
A: Yes! When setting up a doctor's schedule, you can assign them to multiple locations. Patients will see all locations where that doctor is available.

A: Go to the Patients page, find the patient, click Edit, update the phone number, and save.

A: Walk-in appointments are created when patients select "WALK-IN/EMERGENCY" from the WhatsApp menu. They don't have a specific time slot and are seen when the doctor is available. You can view them in the Dashboard with the "Walk-in" filter.
